Today I am doing many things. Bringing my cat to the vet for a Solensia shot, running a Starfinder 2e game in voice chat for some friends, and oh, starting the rebranding process.

I have begun the work of either creating new accounts or renaming old accounts to either brothertocrows or siblingtocrows, depending on what I am able to do, and trying to do new art for them. And yes, I am going to be doing all my own artwork for them, or for my streaming channels, I'll be commissioning designs for them. My degree is in art-design. I do not have the eye for design. Yes, I see the flaw in this.

I have been working on a new me, and the new me needs to let the old me go. To chronicle this, and to keep my followers updated, I've started this blog. I'll try to update every Saturday, and possibly Wednesdays if I can. This will take time, and effort, but I am trying.
